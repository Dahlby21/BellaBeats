The data was gathered from 30 consenting FitBit users, and I sourced it from MÃ¶bius on his Kaggle webpage, which is linked below.

**Questions to be Answered:**

What are some identifiable trends in smart device usage?

How could these trends apply to Bella Beat customers?

How could these trends improve our marketing strategy?

**Summary**

The datasets used contain information logged from ~30 different Fitbit device users who consented to their data being distributed. What I was given to work with was a fairly incomplete, two-part dataset covering two months of most of the users' histories with the device. As a sample size, it has limited value for the scope of the user base but did allow for multiple options when analyzing said data due to the smaller amount provided.

**Cleaning and Transformation:**
The most glaring issue with the raw data that we were working with was the disjointed dates. With a limited amount of data, broadening the range for comparison would allow for a more complete comparison. With a year's worth of findings, cyclical changes could've been a useful measure to document. However, two months was too sparse a sample for much beyond aggregation.

*Both sets were merged along the user id and joined the 3/12/2016-4/11/2016 data with its 4/12/2016-5/12/2016 counterpart.*

**Findings and Conclusion:**
